Worst mod ever made

Putting a lot of effort for this joke mod, as it is my first. Certain civs will have entire sprite sets for their vanilla units, using FantasyHex. Most of the reason I made this mod is for a civ that fits my playstyle. Updates whenever I feel like it.

Current ideas for future civs: Undertale fandom, Fnaf Fandom, Brotherhood of Wood, Morrowboomers, Kingdom of the Squirrels, Bongolia, Sealand, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Factions, that guy, Darth Jar Jar, COD Fandom, Gmod Admins

Suggestions welcome
